# This file provides information about the icons used in the project.

The icons for the Brawl Stars draft bot are sourced from the Supercell fan kit. Each brawler has a corresponding icon that is used throughout the application to enhance the user interface and provide a visual representation of the brawlers.

## Icon Usage

- Icons are displayed in the BrawlerCard component to represent individual brawlers.
- The BrawlerSearch component utilizes icons to help users quickly identify brawlers while searching.
- Icons are also used in the DraftBoard to visually represent selected brawlers.

## Icon Directory

All brawler icons are located in this directory. Ensure that the icons are named consistently with the brawler names for easy reference in the code.

## Adding New Icons

If new brawlers are added to the game, their icons should be downloaded from the Supercell fan kit and added to this directory. Make sure to update any relevant components to include the new brawlers in the draft bot functionality.
